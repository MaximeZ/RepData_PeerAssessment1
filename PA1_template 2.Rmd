Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1
==================================================
#Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

##You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(cars)
```

#Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
